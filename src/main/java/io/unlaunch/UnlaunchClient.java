/**
 * <p>Client for accessing Unlaunch. Provides all features for accessing and evaluating features flags setup through
 * the Unlaunch web console i.e. <a href="https://app.unlaunch.io">https://app.unlaunch.io</a>). UnLaunch is an
 * enterprise-grade feature flags platform inspired by the way you ship features. Deploy your features to
 * production more frequently and with confidence.</p>
 *
 * <p>Sample code to get you started:</p>
 *
 * <code>
 *     UnlaunchClient client = UnlaunchClient.create("your_sdk_key");
 *
 *     String variation = client.getVariation("flagKey", "userId123");
 *     if (variation == "on") {
 *         System.out.println("Variation is on");
 *     } else if (variation == "off") {
 *         System.out.println("Variation is off");
 *     } else {
 *         System.out.println("no variation");
 *     }
 *
 *     client.shutdown();
 * </code>
 *
 *<p>This is the <b>server-side</b> SDK which means it will download all feature flags and associated data
 * upon initialization (and periodically based on settings.)</p>
 *
 * <p>Creating a new client can be an expensive operation and should only be done once and shared in an application
 * The <em>close()</em> method needs to be called on the client object to clean up resources such as threads during
 * application shutdown. To create clients, you can use the <em>create</em> methods such as
 * {@link UnlaunchClient#create(String)} or using the static {@link #builder()} method which returns
 * {@link UnlaunchClientBuilder} which can be used to customize the client.</p>
